How many sql query tools have I created? Like 4?

This one brings together some things I've learned about digging through existing code bases

Built using sequel so that you can connect and analyze a number of different database types, but
it remains to be seen how far we can take it.

In future, I'd like to add code exploration to this as well, but let's just see if we can get this 
vision shipped.

Things to come

* network-graph displays of table relations supporting inferred foreign keys
* read only queries
* inline notes
